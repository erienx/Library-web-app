# Online Library

This platform is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.

## Features:
* User Authentication: register and login system in order to save the cart after closing the browser as well as manage it
* Search: a simple search bar to find books by author or title
* Cart: useable whether logged out/in, upon log in books are added to the user cart where they are kept in a database
* Sliders: interactive sliders for displaying featured books
* Responsive design

## Setup:
To run this webpage locally, you could use XAMPP, here are the steps:

1. Place the project in the **htdocs** folder in XAMPP's location.
2. Using phpMyAdmin import the provided .sql file.
3. Start the Apache and MySQL servers in XAMPP.
4. In your browser, go over to http://localhost and choose the project directory.

## Purpose 
This project was created to get comfortable with PHP, since it's so prevalent in the market - and as I lately discovered - a great stepping stone before moving onto relational databases such as in Spring.
Some refreshing of the basic HTML, CSS and JS combo is always nice as well :>
